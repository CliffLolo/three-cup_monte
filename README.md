# Three Cup Monte
This is a simple implementation of a game where a ball is placed in one of three cups, and the user must guess which cup the ball is in. 
The positions of the cups are shuffled randomly before the user makes their guess. 
The user can enter their name and guess, and the game will check if the guess is correct or not.

### How to run
- Clone the repository.
- Run the code using python interpreter.

The code prompts the user for their name and guess, and then checks if the guess is correct.
If the guess is correct, it will print a message of congratulations to the user, otherwise it will print a message of failure and display the shuffled list.

### Note
- The game can be enhanced in terms of UI, by adding graphics and sound effects.
- It can be made into a web application or mobile application.
- The number of cups and balls can be increased or decreased as per the requirement.
